#:/#~!A Wisemans weapons are patience and disapline" that persona was not a wiseman, I would alter this saying and say a 
#:/#~!Tenacious Man's weapons are Tanacity and Curiosity.. (and a computer with UNIX)

- 👀 I’m interested in leabring more about the basic componoents down the circuitry and its simiplest part on how computers work, their exploits, the ability for people to learn and work around those exploits, and im also interested in proving that there is no program, computer, mainframe, server, and/or IoT device that is or ever will be impenetrable that man makes, because no matter what we cannot make something that is perfect.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning from 0 and teaching myself as much as I possibly can about computers, coding, what makes a computer "work" and how they are designed down to each every soldering point. Simply put I watch, read, and take in as much possible contect on computer science everyday, no matter what the topic is, network, hardware, software, coding languages what each language is best for what type of programs, etc. anything I run into that seems to be pertanent to what my ADHD has put me on that day/week/month
